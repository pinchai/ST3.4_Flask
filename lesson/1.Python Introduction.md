- has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.

_**Python Syntax compared to other programming languages**_

- Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
