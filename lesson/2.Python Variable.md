# Python Variable

_Variables are containers for storing data values._

- **_Creating Variables_**

Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

````
x = 5

y = "John"

print(x)

print(y)

````
````
x = 4  (x is of type int)

x = "Sally" (x is now of type str)

print(x)
````

- **_Casting_**

If you want to specify the data type of a variable,
this can be done with casting.
````
x = str(3)    (x will be '3')
y = int(3)    (y will be 3)
z = float(3)  (z will be 3.0)
````

- **_Get the Type_**

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
````
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
````

- **_Many Values to Multiple Variables_**
````
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
````

- _**One Value to Multiple Variables**_

````
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
````

- **_Unpack a Collection_**
````
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
````
