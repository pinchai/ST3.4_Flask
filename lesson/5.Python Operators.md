# Python Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In the example below, we use the + operator to add
together two values:

_Example:_

````
print(10 + 5)
````

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators

### Arithmetic operators

````
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)

````

### Assignment Operators

````
=
+=
-=
*=
/=
````

### Comparison Operators

````
==
!=
>
<
>=
<=
````

### Logical Operators

````
- and (Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10)
- or  (Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4)
- not (Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10))
````
