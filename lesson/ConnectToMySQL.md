#Connect MySQL to sqlAlchemy In python

To connect MySQL to SQLAlchemy, you will need to install both the MySQL connector for Python and SQLAlchemy.

To install the MySQL connector for Python, you can use pip:

````
pip install mysql-connector-python
````

To install SQLAlchemy, use:


````
pip install sqlalchemy
````

Once both of these libraries are installed, you can use them to connect to a MySQL database in your Python code. Here is an example of how to do this:

````
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Connect to the database
engine = create_engine("mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@host/database")

# Test the connection
connection = engine.connect()
````

Replace user, password, host, and database with the appropriate values for your MySQL server.

This will create a connection to the database. You can then use SQLAlchemy to issue commands to the database using this connection.

For example, you can use the execute method of the connection to execute a SELECT statement:

````
result = connection.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
````

This will execute the SELECT statement and return the results. You can then iterate over the results using a for loop:

````
for row in result:
    print(row)
````

###sqlite
````
con = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute("select * from students")
````
